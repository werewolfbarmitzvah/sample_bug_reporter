A python project that takes in a bug report xml file and formats it into a readable report

I only have done a small portion for jira issues and with no working jira instance have had
to base some assumptions off of the jira python docs (https://jira.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html)

I also only focused on output generated by Android instrumentation tests so this may not work with other
xml outputs at the momemnt


Usage is through entry.py:
python entry.py --destination=jira --file=path/to/file.xml --project=jira project


To run the unit tests:
mkvirtualenv <name>
pip install tox
tox
